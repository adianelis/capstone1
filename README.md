THINKFUL Capstone 1: Analytic Report and Research Proposal


1- Describe your dataset. Describe and explore your dataset in the initial section of your Report. What does your data contain and what is its background? Where does it come from? Why is it interesting or significant? Conduct summary statistics and produce visualizations for the particular variables from the dataset that you will use.

2- Ask and answer analytic questions. Ask three analytic questions and answer each one with a combination of statistics and visualizations. These analytic questions can focus on individuals behaviors or comparisons of the population.

3- Propose further research. Lastly, make a proposal for a realistic future research project on this dataset that would use some data science techniques you'd like to learn in the bootcamp. Just like your earlier questions, your research proposal should present one or more clear questions. Then you should describe the techniques you would apply in order to arrive at an answer.
